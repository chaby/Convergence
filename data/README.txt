The directory "data" contains

- file 'character.csv' contains the table giving the character "echolocation" all extant species of the dataset,
- file 'phylogeny.nwk' contains the phylogeny,
- directory 'alignments' contains a dozen of alignments of the dataset,
- file 'GO_audition.txt' contains the GO-terms related to audition,
- file 'GO_background.txt' contains the list of genes used as backgroung for the enrichment tests,
- file 'GO_description.txt' associates all GO-ident with a short description,
- file 'GO_table.csv' associates all gene idents with the GO-ident which annote it,
- file 'GO_table_audition.csv' associates all gene idents with 'audition' if they are annotated with at least a GO-terms related to audition.
